# CS4760 Project 3: Semaphores and Message Passing

##### DESCRIPTION
Write a program to separate a list of strings, from a file, into 2 other files, and log
program execution. For each string, the program will check if it's a palindrome. Strings
that are palindromes are outputted to "palin.out", otherwise "nopalin.out". Program execution
is logged to "output.log". Regarding the input file, each line should contain only a single
string.

##### BUILD
make

##### EXECUTION
./master -h
./master [-n x] [-s x] [-t time] infile

To fix any issues:
- check shared memory segments: ipcs -m | grep $USER
- check semaphore arrays: ipcs -s | grep $USER
- remove shared memory segments: ipcrm -m | grep $USER | awk ' { print $2 } ' | xargs ipcrm shm
- remove semaphore arrays: ipcs -s | grep $USER | awk ' { print $2 } ' | xargs ipcrm sem
- kill all processes: pkill -u $USER

##### TESTING
make test

##### CLEANUP
make clean

##### ADJUSTMENTS
- Instead of implementing a shared clock, I just used time() in palin (Approved by Bhatia)
- Added new files to improve modularity
- Added test in Makefile

##### CHANGELOG
